The system monitors the latency (RTT) of each node in real-time, automatically allocating more traffic to the optimal node (green dashed border). When a node fails, traffic instantly switches to other available nodes, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity. Each relay node can also be configured with multiple network interfaces to further aggregate bandwidth."
