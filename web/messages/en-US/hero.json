The system monitors each node's latency (RTT) in real-time, automatically allocating more traffic to the optimal node (green dashed box). When a node fails, traffic instantly switches to other available nodes, ensuring uninterrupted connections. Each relay node can also be configured with multiple NICs for further bandwidth aggregation."
