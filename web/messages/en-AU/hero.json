The system monitors each node's latency (RTT) in real-time, automatically allocating more traffic to the optimal node (green dashed box). When a node fails, traffic switches instantly to other available nodes, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity. Each relay node can also be configured with multiple network interfaces for further bandwidth aggregation."
